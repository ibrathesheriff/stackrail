# stackrail
StackRail is a command-line interface (CLI) tool designed to help you efficiently manage and track your coding projects. Inspired by the principles of stack-based organization, MoSCoW prioritization, RICE scoring model and guided progress, StackRail helps you maintain clarity and momentum, especially when picking up projects after a break.

## TODO

## Wrapping v1
[] Cannot run verify if there is no `.profile` file.
[] Add a changelog
[] Updating of tasks
[] Add docs folder:
    - project logo
    - command manual
    - resources used

## Future Work
[] Check if a new task is a duplicate of an existing "open" (i.e. not complete) task
[] When adding a new task compare to "won't have" to ensure it's a relevant task.
[] Question the relevance of a new task. Question the Dev's scoring of the task.
[] Pull tasks from source files - TODO/FIXME/BUG/HACK/COMBAK in code automatically.
[] Use the [Decorator Pattern](https://medium.com/@artemkhrenov/the-decorator-pattern-in-modern-javascript-adding-functionality-without-breaking-code-b43d9c237047)
